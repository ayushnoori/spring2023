Hi! I’m Sandra, a fifth-year PhD student in Harvard’s Program in Speech and Hearing Bioscience and Technology (SHBT). I study how the animal brain learns to associate a certain 'value' to elements in its environment by trial and error. In particular, I am trying to understand how this process of value association can become biased, leading to excessive 'optimism' or 'pessimism' that is characteristic of certain psychiatric disorders. I am very excited to meet you all this semester and discuss about intelligence. Please reach to me for whatever you may need!
