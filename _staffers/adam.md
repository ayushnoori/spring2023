Hi! I'm Adam, a fifth-year PhD student in Harvard's Program in Neuroscience. I study how animals learn from rewards and punishments, and specifically, whether the mechanisms the mammalian brain uses to do this are similar to recently-developed methods in machine learning that accomplish the same task. So I'm extremely excited to explore the link between natural and artificial intelligence with all of you!Â
