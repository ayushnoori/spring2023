I'm a graduate student in the neuroscience program broadly interested in computation, learning, and memory in single cells. I aim to combine theoretical and experimental approaches to investigate the mechanisms underlying information storage in unicellular organisms like Paramecia and in single neurons. Looking forward to a fun and enriching semester with you all! Please come and give me company at office hours :)Â
