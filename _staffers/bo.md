Bio - I am Bo Liu, a G4 PhD student from MCO program. I am interested in the Neuro-AI interface. Currently, I am working with Prof. Venkatesh Murthy and Dr. Yuhai Tu (IBM) on computational olfaction: given that we have one nose and two nostrils (which, combined with anatomy, suggests that we have two different odor representations on two sides of the brain), our model showed that learning between two hemispheres aligns these two representations.
