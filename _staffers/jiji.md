Hi, Iâ€™m Jiji, a Pharm.D. and 5th-year Ph.D. student in Jeffrey Macklis's lab. I currently study molecular mechanisms that regulate the development of precise circuitry in the cortex, known to be involved in higher cognitive and associative functions. Looking forward to meeting you all. Always happy to chat. Please feel free to come and say hi, and ask any questions.
