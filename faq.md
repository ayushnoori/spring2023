This page is for frequently asked questions. Please check this page as well as the [syllabus](https://gened1125.github.io/spring2022/syllabus/) to see if your question has already been answered **before** reaching out to [Prof. Murthy](mailto:vnmurthy@fas.harvard.edu) and [Lucy](mailto:lucylai@g.harvard.edu). If you don't see your question here, please email **both** of us!

## What happens if I test positive for COVID during the semester and can't attend class / section?
_Under construction._

## Can I take this course if I'm not from a computer science or neuroscience background?
Yes! This course is supposed to be an **introduction** to topics in artificial and natural intelligence. We've had students from all kinds of concentations take this course, including Social Studies, Government, and East Asian Studies. We really value all kinds of perspectives in our discussions, especially when we talk about controversial topics, for example, the ethics of AI!

## What will the problem sets consist of? Do I need to know how to code or do statistics?
The problem sets will be a mix of discussion questions (e.g., is it ethical to use neural prosthetics to enhance cognition?) and technical questions (e.g., please calculate the time delay between neural signal A and neural signal B reaching the brain). You do **not** need to know how to code or do statistics, but you will at times need to perform basic calculations from formulas that we will teach and explain. Everything you need to know to complete the psets will be covered in lecture or section. 

## Do I have to write a paper for the final exam? 
The final paper is an oppourtunity to explore a topic from the course in more depth. You can either write a "review" paper summarizing a subtopic discussed in the course, or write an "opinion" paper arguing a side of a debate (e.g., is it ethical to track people's browsing data?). However, individuals with a creative idea may elect to do a project instead of writing a paper. For example, you may choose to survey people's level of comfort with AI tracking their personal data, and then analyze and report the survey data. For those wh are technically inclined, you could come up with a coding project that uses neural networks to generate music or art. Creativity is encouraged! **All students** (whether writing a paper or doing a project) will have to get their idea approved by the professor / their section TF beforehand. More details about the assignment will be given at a later date.

## Can I change sections? Can I attend a section that I'm not assigned to?
We will use my.Harvard's sectioning tool to assign sections. You will be able to rank sections in the order of your preference, and we will try our best to honor that preference. If in the case you are assigned to a section that conflicts with another course, please email the Head TF, [Lucy](mailto:lucylai@g.harvard.edu). You must attend the section that you were assigned to get credit for section attendance. 

## Can I audit the course or take it pass / fail?
Pass / failing and auditing is by instructor permission only and under limited circumstances. Please email both [Prof. Murthy](mailto:vnmurthy@fas.harvard.edu) and [Lucy](mailto:lucylai@g.harvard.edu) with your specific situation.

## Where can I get extra help outside of section?
Both Prof. Murthy and Lucy will host weekly office hours. Prof. Murthy's office hours will be XXX, and Lucy's will be Friday, 4:15-5:15PM in the Quincy DHall and by [Zoom](https://harvard.zoom.us/my/lucylai/).

## Can I turn in my assignment late and still get credit?
The late policy says that you will get 1 point deducted for every day that it is late. For example, if the PSET is due Friday and you turn it in on Monday, you will be deducted 3 points from your final score. Remember, each PSET is worth a total of 10 points. The latest you can turn a PSET in and still recieve credit (with the late penalties) is next Wednesday @ 11:59PM.
