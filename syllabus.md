## About
What is intelligence? An inquiry into the nature of intelligence can take different forms â€“ philosophical, biological, mathematical or technological. In this course, we will use machine intelligence (everything from voice recognizing smartphones to game-playing computers) as a handle to think about natural intelligence (brains and behavior of animals). Although we will start with big, general questions, we will quickly move to concrete queries about brains and computers. This approach, rather than just starting with brains of animals, may be useful in framing more universal questions independent of the specific architecture of brains of animals. As machines increasingly perform tasks that were once thought to be solely in the domain of humans, there is an urgent need for discussions of the moral and societal implications of artificial intelligence. This course targets students interested in brains and computers in equal measure, and who are comfortable discussing ethical concerns.

## Class Notes
Class notes and material will be released on the course website

## Assignments
Problem sets will be a mix of short-form discussion questions and simple technical problems. 

## Course Prerequisites
There are no formal prerequisites to this course, and students do not need to be from a technical or science background. Some basic high school math may be required for some problem sets.

## Assessment
10% - Lecture attendance / participation*
10% - Section attendance / participation
40% - Problem sets (4 total), 10% each
20% - Mid-term take-home exam
20% - Final paper

*Lectures will be interactive, with discussions throughout. Lectures will also be live-recorded and released after each class.
